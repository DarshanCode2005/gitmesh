# GitMesh CE Roadmap

## Roadmap Philosophy

For this project, maintaining a continuously updated, linear roadmap document is not considered effective. Instead, the project adopts a **parallel roadmap approach** that better reflects its development workflow and evolving priorities.

## Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is organized as a **tree-structured model** rather than a sequential list of milestones:

- Each **issue** represents a distinct component, capability, or direction of the project.
- Issues collectively define the short-term and long-term evolution of the system.
- Development progresses in parallel, not linearly.

## Workflow

- Contributors focus on **one issue at a time**.
- Multiple issues may be active concurrently.
- Progress across these issues incrementally moves the project toward overall system stability.

## Roadmap Representation

- Issues will later be assigned **labels** that indicate their roadmap significance.
- Labeled issues will together constitute the **official roadmap** for GitMesh CE.
- This approach ensures the roadmap remains accurate, actionable, and closely aligned with real development work.

## Stability Goal

This model remains in effect until the system reaches a stable state, at which point roadmap practices may be revisited or formalized further.
